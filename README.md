# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

**Summary:**

This repository is a React-based chat client that interacts with a backend server via WebSocket communication using Socket.IO. The client offers a user-friendly interface for real-time messaging, allowing users to send and receive messages instantly. It integrates seamlessly with the backend server, enabling robust and responsive chat functionality.

**Key Features:**

- **Real-time Messaging:** Utilizes WebSocket technology via Socket.IO for instant message delivery.
- **User Interface:** Built with React to provide a modern and intuitive chat experience.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures optimal viewing and interaction across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Customizable:** Easily adaptable to incorporate additional features or styling enhancements as needed.
- **Simple Integration:** Designed for straightforward integration with any compatible backend server supporting Socket.IO.

**Setup Instructions:**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KindrakevychNatali/chat-client.git
   cd chat-client
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Access the chat client:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

**Usage:**

- Start the development server and open the client to begin chatting in real-time.
- Customize and extend the client application as per specific requirements or use cases.

**Contributing:**

Contributions are welcome! Fork the repository, implement your changes, and submit a pull request for review.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
